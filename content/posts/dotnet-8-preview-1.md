Just over 3 months after the [release of the .NET 7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-7), since 21st February 2023, we have the first preview of the .NET 8 which is a long-term support (LTS) release. In fact, it was expected given the .NET release lifecycle. 

New release candidate builds will be delivered over the next few months, one each month, until November 2023 when the final .NET release will be delivered at the [.NET Conf](https://www.dotnetconf.net/).

Since 2014 [.NET is open source](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-open-source/) and in addition to the .NET team, a large community around the world collaborates with its improvements.

So, do you want to take a look at [what's new in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8)? You can download [.NET 8 Preview 1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0), for Windows, macOS, and Linux and enjoy it!

See you soon!
