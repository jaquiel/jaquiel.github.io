# About

My name is Jaquiel Paim. I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil, currently living and working in Portugal! I've working with C#/.NET (.NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET 5, .NET 6 and .NET 7), more specifically as Backend Developer ( developing RESTful APIs ) and a tiny bit as Frontend Developer ( working with React ). However, I also like to try another programming languages and technologies like Node.js, Typescript, Golang and Python among others.
