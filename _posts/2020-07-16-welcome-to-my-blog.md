Hello everyone! Thanks for reading this post. It is the first post of a new journey of many others. I am starting this blog to discuss the most varied subjects related to software engineering and programming languages.

I really enjoy learning about the differences in the programming language and its paradigms. So, if you, like me, like to learn more about old and new technologies, I invite you to follow me here.

I hope to see you soon!

Best regards.
